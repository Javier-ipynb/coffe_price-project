# Project Title:
Historical Coffee Prices

# Description:
Using a dataset that contains coffee prices over the years, the idea is to create a machine learning model that can predict future prices. To achieve this, I worked with time series algorithms as well as more "classical" machine learning algorithms.

# Data Acquisition:
This dataset was downloaded from the official Kaggle website. The explanation of the columns and the download link are included in the project.

# Final Model Performance for the Project:
In the project, there are several failed models, but this is intentional. My idea is to demonstrate that even when working with time series, these algorithms can sometimes be more complex to work with and harder to capture patterns, making it much easier to work with simpler algorithms. Nevertheless, my main goal is to showcase my knowledge of time series algorithms and apply them in the project.
